DisplacementText=A displacement reaction occurs when a more reactive metal 'displaces' \
  a less reactive metal cation, according to their reactivity. This feature helps you \
  visualise displacements easily.
AcidBaseText=Acids and bases are common in our daily lives, from the hydrochloric acid in \
  your stomach to the bleach used to clean clothes. See how acids and bases neutralise each \
  other, forming salts.
MyCompoundsText=Add your own compounds and give them properties. This will be very helpful \
  when your Chemistry exam is nearing!

HelpDescription=Elemix is a Chemistry application that helps you predict reactions and store \
  your compounds.\n\nThe first two reaction tabs help you to predict if a displacement reaction \
  would occur, based on the reactivity series, while the acid-base tab helps you to balance \
  reactions and find out the salt obtained.\n\nFinally, you can store your own compounds and \
  add colour-coded properties to them. This would be useful when organising compounds you have \
  learnt in class. For example, you could add acids such as HF, HCl, HBr and HI and tag them as \
  "acidic" or "monoprotic".

AboutProgrammerHeader=About the Programmer
InfoDescription=Elemix was created by Lee I-Shiang for a certain CS3233 module at NUS High School.\
  \n\nThis project was conceptualised because this creator did not exactly have any idea what to \
  do and he just decided to create a Chemistry programme because that's what he likes.
